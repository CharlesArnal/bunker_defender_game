# Lonely Commander
A simple "defend the bunker"-type game that I coded in high school (which is why everything is Warhammer 40K-themed). Shoot enemies, get rewards, buy upgrades.
Instructions are in French, but everything is fairly straightforward.
I own none of the pictures or songs used, and am willing to take anything down (though this is all purely for fun, and I am making no profit out of it).

# Setup
Download every file and folder, put everything in the same folder, and open "Starting_page_OPEN_ME" with a web browser (works with Firefox and Chrome, might be buggy with others).
