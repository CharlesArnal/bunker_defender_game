# Lonely Commander
A simple "defend the bunker"-type game that I coded in high school (which is why everything is Warhammer 40K-themed). 
Code is in Javascript and HTML.
Shoot enemies, get rewards, buy upgrades.
Instructions are in French, but everything is fairly straightforward.
I own none of the pictures or songs used, and am willing to take anything down (though this is all purely for fun, and I am making no profit out of it).

# Installation
Download every file and folder, put everything in the same folder, and open "Starting_page_OPEN_ME" with a web browser (works with Firefox and Chrome, might be buggy with others).
Feel free not to download the "images" and "sons" folders if you do not care for the soundtracks and appearance of the start menu; the gameplay should not be impacted.
